            During exercise, your body may need three or four times your normal cardiac output, because your muscles need more oxygen when you exert yourself.
            During exercise, your heart typically beats faster so that more blood gets out to your body.
            Your heart can also increase its stroke volume by pumping more forcefully or increasing the amount of blood that fills the left ventricle before it pumps. Generally speaking, your heart beats both faster and stronger to increase cardiac output during exercise.
            Diet plays an important role in good circulation. 
            Trans fats, saturated fats, excess salt, and added sugars can all negatively impact circulation. 
            Eating a healthy diet full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, oily fish, and nuts may help improve circulation.
