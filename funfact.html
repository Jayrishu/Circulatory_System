            There is a common misconception that deoxygenated blood and veins are blue but that is not true. The reason why they look blue under your skin near your wrists is because blue light is reflected back to our eyes. Blue light does not penetrate human tissue as deeply as red light does. As a result, veins that are close to the surface of the skin will be more likely to reflect blue light back to the eye whereas they are actually red.           <br> <br>
            There are 45 trillion red blood cells in our body!
            <br><br>
            There are 4,000-11,000 white blood cells in each microliter of blood!

            The nutrients that your blood transport to the body come from the small intestine where the nutrients from the food we eat are absorbed by the blood and delivered to the body.
