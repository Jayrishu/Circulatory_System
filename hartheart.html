            Your heart is divided into four chambers. You have two chambers on the top (atrium, plural atria) and two on the bottom (ventricles), one on each side of the heart.
            <br>
            Right atrium: Two large veins deliver oxygen-poor blood to your right atrium. The superior vena cava carries blood from your upper body. The inferior vena cava brings blood from the lower body. Then the right atrium pumps the blood to your right ventricle.
            <br>
            Right ventricle: The lower right chamber pumps the oxygen-poor blood to your lungs through the pulmonary artery. The lungs reload blood with oxygen.
            <br>
            Left atrium: After the lungs fill blood with oxygen, the pulmonary veins carry the blood to the left atrium. This upper chamber pumps the blood to your left ventricle.
            <br>
            Left ventricle: The left ventricle is slightly larger than the right. It pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body.</p>
            <br><br>
            
          <p class="btn-warning">  Your heart valves are like doors between your heart chambers. They open and close to allow blood to flow through.
            <br>
            "The atrioventricular (AV) valves open between your upper and lower heart chambers." They include:
            <br>
            "Tricuspid valve: Door between your right atrium and right ventricle."
            <br>
            "Mitral valve: Door between your left atrium and left ventricle."
            <br>
            Semilunar (SL) valves open when blood flows out of your ventricles. They include:
            <br>
            
            "Aortic valve: Opens when blood flows out of your left ventricle to your aorta (artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to your body)."
            <br>
            Pulmonary valve: Opens when blood flows from your right ventricle to your pulmonary arteries (the only arteries that carry oxygen-poor blood to your lungs).
